"""
Generate and Update GB eligible members.

As of GB Date if they have dues of > 6 months (from the date of the GB) they are not eligible

Letâ€™s say annual subscription is $600 and if the member has paid $300 which is equal to 6 months. So in Sept, (Month 9)
he doesn't have 6 months of outstanding; only July - Sept (3 months) hence the member is eligible.

The invoices are checked to see if they were modified at the beginning of this year (as they should be when creating new
invoices after Jan 1). If this check is not there, in Xero, we will get all invoices from years past.

Principle: Loop through all members. For each member, check each invoice. Set eligibility to False and prove it's True
by checking invoices. The moment you can prove eligibility is False, break the loop and check the next member.
